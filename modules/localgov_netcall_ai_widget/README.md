## INTRODUCTION

The LocalGov Netcall AI Widget module allows sites to embed the Netcall AI widget on their website.

You can enable it sitewide so it appears on all pages. Once that is done, you can overide it on a page-by-page basis or site-section basis to show other versions of the widget in other places.

## REQUIREMENTS

This module has no other requirements.

## INSTALLATION
